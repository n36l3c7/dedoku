"""The solving engine that chains logical techniques.

:class:`SudokuSolver` repeatedly walks an ordered pipeline of techniques,
always retrying from the simplest one after each successful deduction —
exactly how a human solver escalates only when the easy moves dry up.
The engine never guesses: if no technique applies, it stops and reports
a partial result.
