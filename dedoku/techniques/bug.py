"""Bivalue Universal Grave (BUG) technique, in its BUG+1 form.

A *bivalue universal grave* is a board state where every unsolved cell has
exactly two candidates and every candidate appears exactly twice in each
house. Such a state can never belong to a puzzle with a unique solution:
the remaining digits could be assigned in two complementary ways.

The practical *BUG+1* deduction: when every unsolved cell is bivalue
except a single cell with three candidates, that cell must take the one
candidate appearing three times in its row, column, and subgrid — placing
any other value would leave the board as a deadly BUG. Like the other
uniqueness arguments, this assumes the puzzle has exactly one solution.
