"""Naked candidate techniques: Single, Pair, Triple, and Quad.

A *naked* subset is a group of ``n`` unsolved cells inside one house whose
candidates, taken together, span exactly ``n`` digits. Those digits must go
into those cells, so they can be eliminated from every other cell of the
house. With ``n = 1`` the cell simply receives its only candidate.
