"""A pure-Python Sudoku solver based on human-style logical deduction.

The package exposes an object-oriented board model (:class:`Cell`,
:class:`Row`, :class:`Column`, :class:`Subgrid`, :class:`Grid`) and a
logic-only solving engine (:class:`SudokuSolver`) that never resorts to
backtracking. It has no external dependencies.

Individual techniques live in :mod:`dedoku.techniques`.

    Convenience wrapper around :class:`Grid` and :class:`SudokuSolver`:
    parses the 81-character puzzle, solves it with the chosen method,
    and returns the outcome with the final board in ``result.grid``.

    :param puzzle: The puzzle description accepted by
        :meth:`Grid.from_string`.
    :type puzzle: str
    :param method: How to solve. ``"logic"`` (default) uses the
        explainable techniques only and may stall on the hardest
        puzzles; ``"hybrid"`` runs the techniques first and completes
        any remainder by brute force; ``"backtracking"`` skips the
        techniques and brute-forces directly. Non-default methods
        record their brute-force part as an explicit ``"Backtracking"``
        step (see ``result.used_backtracking``).

    :param assume_unique: When ``False``, uniqueness-based techniques are
        excluded, keeping every deduction sound even if the puzzle might
        have multiple solutions. Recommended together with ``"hybrid"``
        when the puzzle is not guaranteed to have one solution.
    :type assume_unique: bool
    :returns: The session outcome; ``result.grid`` holds the final board
        and ``result.steps`` the full explainable solving path.
    :rtype: SolveResult
    :raises ValueError: If ``method`` is not one of the three modes.
    :raises InvalidGridError: If the puzzle description is malformed or
        its givens contradict each other.

        by logic, or proven exhaustively by the non-default methods).
